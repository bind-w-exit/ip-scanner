# IP Scanner (In Development) 🚧

IP Scanner is a planned network scanner application for analyzing LAN. The aim is to provide functionality to show all network devices, give access to shared folders, offer remote control of computers (via RDP and Radmin), and even remotely switch computers off. The application is intended to be user-friendly and designed to operate as a portable edition.

## Planned Key Features
- ✅ Scanning local networks to identify connected devices
- ✅ Providing easy access to network shares
- ❌ Allowing remote control via RDP and Radmin
- ✅ Detecting MAC addresses
- ❌ Enabling switching on/off computers remotely
- ✅ Supporting scanning of different IP address ranges
- ✅ Analyzing and recognizing different classes of IP addresses (Class A, B, C)

## Note on Usage
Unauthorized network scanning can be considered illegal and unethical activity, and can cause substantial disruptions in network operation. Always obtain the necessary permissions and comply with relevant laws and guidelines when performing network scanning.
